# vue-word-translator

A simple word translator app built with Vue.js using the [Yandex Translate API](https://tech.yandex.com/translate/). 
Uses [Axios](https://github.com/mzabriskie/axios) to make the API request.  
A custom Bootstrap theme from [Bootswatch](https://bootswatch.com/) for styling. 

I choose to use Spanish, Chinese, and Polish as the language options for the app, because I can speak these languages at various capabilities.
